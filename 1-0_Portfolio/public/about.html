<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
  Hi, I'm Elia Rossi. <br>
  I was born and raised in Rimini, where I graduated from high school with a focus on physics and chemistry. I then went on to study Design in Faenza, where I obtained two degrees.
  I have always had a great passion for the outdoors and sports, but also for video games and tabletop role-playing games.
  At this time I started studying as a Web Developer
